# IoT-Based-Automatic-Saline-Level-Monitoring-System
The project aimed to enhance patient safety by enabling real-time monitoring of saline  levels using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, HX711 load cell sensor, and a servo motor. The  system transmitted data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform and sent automatic alerts when  saline levels dropped below a defined threshold.
